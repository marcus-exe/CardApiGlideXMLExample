# CardApiGlideXMLExample

It's some simple CardView using Glide lib for deserializing and loading an image.

There are 4 cards:

1) The URL is ok and has no delay
2) The URL is ok but has a 5s delay - sync
3) The URL is ok but has a 5s delay - async
4) The URL is broken
I also reuse the card layout inside the main layout using xml include
